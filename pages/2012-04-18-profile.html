<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Present Design of IndoRama</span></strong><br />
Indorama Synthetics Ltd. LAN/WAN Network, there was no security for data communication across the world. The Intruders can easily made there system to compromise accordingly to their skill and loss of data’s occurs many times. The Intruders were easily make there SMTP Server to generate spam mail and generate the traffic on Network and WAN link (ISP)<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cisco Pix Implementation </span></strong><br />
The project is to deploy the security solution for protecting the network from outside threat. For this 2 PIX 515e series, firewall devices in failover configuration mode are being used. One PIX firewall devices is used as primary and other as standby for the redundancy. Three interfaces for both the PIX will be used for outside, inside and stateful failover.<br />
We design our Pix in such a way to understand our network (LAN/WAN) requirement and act accordingly to proposed design. i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only HTTP/HTTPS/POP3 access from outside to inside for Internet users. All Services restricted from outside to inside.</li>
<li>Only Mail Server access from outside to inside through spectra net for mobile Users.</li>
<li>All  Services allowed from inside to outside.</li>
<li>Back-up internet connectivity through ISDN from VSNL for inside users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Remote Locations:</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><br />
For emote locations, we installed Cisco Pix 515e firewall without failover configuration.<br />
<strong>Design &amp; Implementation of Lease and  Backup ISDN Line  on Cisco 1760 &amp; 1750 Router.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customer requirement was to Implement ISDN line as a Backup of Lease Line.</li>
<li>Lease Line was there to connect two buildings but suppose if it gets down there was no backup to Connect toMainBuilding.</li>
<li>Designed the configuration as per there requirement. Primary Link was Lease Line, Once it gets down automatically it get switch over to ISDN Line as per the configuration.</li>
<li>If Internet ISP Link also gets down it will switchover to ISDN Line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation</span></strong><strong> </strong><br />
The configuration and testing of all the Cisco components and Modems for the leased line will be jointly done along with M/S Tata Telesevices Ltd and  Indo Rama.<br />
The pure 2 Mbps Lease line link provided by M/S Tata Teleservices Ltd will be established between Dr. Gopal Das Bhawan (Barakhamba Road) &amp; Mohan Dev (Tolstoy Marg) of Indo Rama. The primary link between the above two locations will be leased line with Cisco Router 1760 installed at Dr. Gopal Das Bhawan and Cisco Router 1750 at Mohan Dev office. One IDSN card of Router 1760 will act as secondary link and in case of failure of Lease line it will automatically switch to 128 Kbps ISDN and vice versa. Once the Lease line is restored. The second ISDN card of Router 1760 will be used for  Mail forwarding.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Server upgrade from Novell to Windows NT</span></strong><br />
Previously INDORAMA used Novell as a File &amp; Print Server, for there local Network, In Novell long file name is not support, which was big problem for the client users, we upgraded, the server from Novell to Windows.<br />
